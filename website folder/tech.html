        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>George El-Hachem is an undergraduate, majoring in
             Computer Engineering at New York University.
              George has taken essential courses like 
              “Data structures and algorithm” and 
              “Object Oriented Programming.” 
              George is advanced in three programming languages:
               C++, Python, MongoDB, Javascript, Html, and CSS.
                George is an ambitious person who loves the field of programming and the tech industry as a whole. He loves learning more about it and teaching it to others about it.
        </p>
        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <p>
            -	George has worked and still works on big projects. One project that he is in is the Augmented Library project where George and his colleagues are developing a software application for the New York University libraries. The application includes augmented reality for library tours and allows students to easily access e-textbooks, room reservations, and many more. George works in the back-end sub-team, which is split into two more sub-teams: augmented reality and database. Both sub-teams use MongoDB to code the application. George currently works in both sub-teams, since he is really curious about the tech industry in this world and will do as much as he can to boost his knowledge about it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            -	Another project he has worked on is a biomedical watch. The purpose of the watch is to measure the heart rate of the user and to display a warning when the heart rate is too high or too low. George worked on this project with two other people who helped complete this project. The watch was designed on CAD Fusion 360, powered by a circuit built from scratch, and the display on the screen was programmed using C++.
